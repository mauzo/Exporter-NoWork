Exporter::NoWork
================

This provides a trivial interface to exporting functions: all functions
whose names do not begin with an underscore are considered exportable.
There are options to handle automagically exporting all CONSTANT_SUBS.

INSTALLATION

It is possible to install this module manually, by typing

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

but it is highly recommended that you use CPAN.pm or one of the other
automatic interfaces to CPAN to install it for you.
